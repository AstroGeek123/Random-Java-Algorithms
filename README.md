# Random-Java-Algorithms
This repository contains absolutely random algorithms that I developed to solve the most random problems. I had way too much time on my hands, so I developed way too many algorithms (and Java isn't even my main language so I dunno why I used it in the first place). I'll be drowning in commits at this rate. Help please.
